# heart-disease-failure
This project aims to develop a robust system for predicting heart disease failure by training and evaluating multiple machine learning models individually. We will collect and preprocess a comprehensive dataset containing various patient attributes, including demographic information, medical history, and clinical measurements. Several distinct classification algorithms, such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting,Neural networks will be independently trained on this prepared data. The performance of each model will be meticulously assessed using key metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to determine their individual effectiveness. Ultimately, the project seeks to identify the most promising model for accurate and reliable prediction of heart disease failure, aiding in early intervention and improved patient outcomes.
